# Preface

This book is both a resource and an experiment. For the reader it is a resource, since I provide a write-up of my research over the last decade. It is also an experiment, since I write the book "open source", publishing it on the go.

This book is based on the Norwegian-only book *Musikk og bevegelse* (Jensenius, 2009), which again was based on my Ph.D. dissertation (Jensenius, 2007). Much of the same material is covered in this book, but it is updated to include my latest research, as well as knowledge gained from teaching a course on music and movement for the last years.
